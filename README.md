## Background

At _The Hackers Playbook_, we are committed to building cutting-edge AI infrastructure and platforms grown out of Bharat (India). AuxKnow represents a significant milestone in our mission to deliver robust, developer-friendly tools for crafting AI-driven solutions. We encourage you to explore, innovate, and share your insights to help us improve and evolve. We look forward to your participation in our mission, since we are largely community driven and believe in Open Source culture.

AuxKnow leverages the capabilities of [Perplexity‚Äôs Sonar models](https://sonar.perplexity.ai/) to enable seamless integration of "Answer Engine" functionality. While Perplexity‚Äôs models provide the foundational technology, AuxKnow bridges the gap by delivering a highly configurable and user-friendly library to accelerate application development.

## Key Features

- **Fully Customizable**: Configure AuxKnow to align perfectly with your application‚Äôs requirements. Its flexibility ensures it can adapt to various use cases, from simple Q&A to complex contextual reasoning.

- **Dynamic Query Routing**: Automatically route user queries to the most appropriate model, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.

- **Intelligent Query Restructuring**: AuxKnow restructures user queries to improve response quality, delivering more accurate and relevant answers.

- **Contextual Search**: AuxKnow can either leverage predefined contexts or autonomously build its own context to ensure that answers remain grounded in relevant knowledge.

- **Session Management**: Seamlessly manage user interactions, including access to session history, context updates, and session resets. Export session data for analytics and debugging.

- **Streaming Responses**: Enable real-time, incremental response generation for an enhanced user experience.

- **Source Attribution**: Responses include detailed citations, ensuring transparency and reliability by grounding answers in trustworthy sources.

## Installation

Install AuxKnow with a single command:

```bash
pip install auxknow
```

---

## Usage Instructions

To begin using AuxKnow, ensure you have the required API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`) configured in a `.env` file in your project‚Äôs root directory.

Here is an example of how to get started:

```python
from auxknow import AuxKnow

# Initialize the Answer Engine
engine = AuxKnow()

# Ask a question
response = engine.ask("What is the capital of France?")

# Print the response and its citations
print(response.answer)
print(response.citations)
```

---

## Use Cases

AuxKnow is designed to cater to a wide range of scenarios, including:

- **Vertical AI Agents**: Build domain-specific AI agents tailored to industries such as healthcare, education, finance, or technology.

- **Advanced Q&A Systems**: Integrate robust answering capabilities into your applications, powered by state-of-the-art Sonar models.
